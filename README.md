# Chitty-Chat

A command line chat service ðŸ—¨


## Deployment

To run our project and create a server run:

```bash
  go run launch.go server
```
When it's successfully set up, open a new terminal and run:

```bash
  go run launch.go client
```

You can open as many clients as you like, just make sure you have a terminal for each of them. ðŸ’ª

When you have the desired number of clients, you can chat with yourself. ðŸ¤ ðŸ‘Œ
